## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Pseudo-elements

### What I learned

I have just learned how to use @font-face rules in CSS.
Typically, I use Google Fonts and import them into my HTML or CSS file.
Additionally, I have gained knowledge about using pseudo-elements for decoration.

### Continued development

I want to focus on writing semantic HTML and also using pseudo-elements for decoration purposes.
I want to continuously improve how I write CSS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This documentation help me a lot to understand
  concept of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments

As you can see, I added some cool hover effects to social links. I learned that from the course "The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2024 Edition" by Colt Steele that I bought from Udemy. Go check that out. It is a good course for beginners.
